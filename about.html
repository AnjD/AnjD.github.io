					I received my degree from Smith College, in Computer Science and Astronomy, in June of 2018.  In September of 2018 I received my Professional Scrum Master I certification.  This certification demonstrates that I have an understanding of Scrum and know how to apply it in Scrum Teams.  On April 13th, 2019 I received the Microsoft Certification 98-381: Introduction to Programming Using Python.   To achieve this certification, I displayed knowledge of data types, operators, decisions, loops, input and output operations, and error handling in Python. As of June of 2019, I have completed the course Spark and Python for Big Data with PySpark, a tool in Python made to help assist in the implementation of Machine Learning methods.

					Currently I am working at Avanade, a technology consulting company, as a Data Analyst.  My experience at Avanade has allowed me to further my skills in Excel data preparation, analysis, and visualization.  My first project dealt with a Windows 10 Migration in which I was in charge of contacting end-users of the company and scheduling them for their computer upgrades.  I also met with third party vendors to schedule migration appointments and review statistics on migration completion.  My second project, at a utility client, involved me recording progress, creating preparation documents, and verifying the results of User Acceptance Testing (UAT).  I regularly met with the client to report on the status and outcomes of testing.

					I am very passionate about furthering my skills and knowledge in Machine Learning.  In the past I have developed a predictive algorithm to determine the status of exo-planets, planets outside of our solar system, using the NASA Kepler mission data.  The task was to determine which planets would be the most earth-like and habitable.  The algorithm was developed in Python using the Pandas Library.  I determined the best way to identify the most important predictor was to create a decision tree.  Using the results of the tree I was able to predict the outcome of the candidate planets.  From the 2,000+ candidates 800 were predicted to be earth-like and habitable.  I have also created a machine learning algorithm to predict which type of vehicles were more likely to get into an accident.  I plan to pursue a Master of Science degree in Data Science in the near future and have started looking into several programs.
