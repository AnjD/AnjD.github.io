					I received my degree from Smith College, in Computer Science and Astronomy, in June of 2018.  In September of 2018 I received my Professional Scrum Master I certification.  This certification demonstrates that I have an understanding of Scrum and know how to apply it in Scrum Teams.  On April 13th, 2019 I received the Microsoft Certification 98-381: Introduction to Programming Using Python.   To achieve this certification, I displayed knowledge of data types, operators, decisions, loops, input and output operations, and error handling in Python. As of June of 2019, I have completed the course Spark and Python for Big Data with PySpark, a tool in Python made to help assist in the implementation of Machine Learning methods. In August of 2020 I recieved my certification in Azure Funamentals (AZ-900).  This certification required me to have knowledge in Azure funcionalties such as the set up of virtual machines, virtual networks and the importance and set up of internet security.  In July of 2021, I recieved my certification in Azure Data Fundamentals (DP-900).  This certification showed that I have foundational knowledge of core data concepts and how they are implemented using Microsoft Azure data services.  It also shows that I am familiar with the concepts of relational and non-relational data, and different types of data workloads such as transactional or analytical.

					Currently I am working at Avanade, a technology consulting company, as a Data Analyst.  My experience at Avanade has allowed me to further my skills in Excel data preparation, analysis, and visualization.  My first project dealt with a Windows 10 Migration in which I was in charge of contacting end-users of the company and scheduling them for their computer upgrades.  I also met with third party vendors to schedule migration appointments and review statistics on migration completion.  My second project, at a utility client, involved me recording progress, creating preparation documents, and verifying the results of User Acceptance Testing (UAT).  I regularly met with the client to report on the status and outcomes of testing. On this project I have also created a calculating tool using advanced Excel spreadsheet functions and VBA to ensure the correct results were generated in the client's billing system.  My current project, at a New York State Client, involved performing data profiling, using Microsoft SQL Server, in preparation for data migration.  I created various SQL queries to identify issues and gaps in client data, convened with clients twice a week to discuss gaps in knowledge and further steps in data cleansing, and produced a deliverable document to highlight steps for data migration and cleansing. I also worked with key business representatives, data owners, end users, application designers and data architects to model current and new data.

					I am very passionate about furthering my skills and knowledge in Machine Learning.  In the past I have developed a predictive algorithm to determine the status of exo-planets, planets outside of our solar system, using the NASA Kepler mission data.  The task was to determine which planets would be the most earth-like and habitable.  The algorithm was developed in Python using the Pandas Library.  I determined the best way to identify the most important predictor was to create a decision tree.  Using the results of the tree I was able to predict the outcome of the candidate planets.  From the 2,000+ candidates 800 were predicted to be earth-like and habitable.  I have also created a machine learning algorithm to predict which type of vehicles were more likely to get into an accident.  I plan to pursue a Master of Science degree in Data Science in the near future and have started looking into several programs.
